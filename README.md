# Movie Saga


## Description
Description

Duration: 10 hours
I was given a repository that rendered movie titles and their poster on the dom. I was tasked with getting details about a specific movie when the poster was clicked. I needed to: 
- load the movie details on a new page.
- make a GET request to the server and database for to receive the details for a specific movie id.
- refactor the data from the database to render the movie title, poster, description, and all the genres associated.
- use redux and sagas for my GET request and variables.
- have a button that exists on the details page that will bring the user back to the main page with all the movies.


Make a Plan
1. I started this project by opening the given repository and looking around to understand the code I had been given.
2. Next, I drew out a plan for how I wanted my pages to look, along with routes, function, and variables I would need for each page.
3. Then, I went back to the code and added comments, showing the path the requests would make and planning my variable/function names.
4. Finally, I started coding, making sure to use comments to explain the code I was adding.
5. I decided to push my understanding by using Tailwind for my styling. I had never used Tailwind before so I needed to learn how to install it appropriately as well as learn the correct notation. Below are some pictures of the final result.


Prerequisites
- Node.js

Installation
1. Create a database named your database name,
2. The queries in the tables.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
4. Run npm run server in your terminal
5. Run npm run client in your terminal
